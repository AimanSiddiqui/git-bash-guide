##### git-clone-downloads-the-remote-repo-to-local-repo

In its simplest (and most common) form, only the repository URL is specified:

	$ cd folder/to/clone-into/
	$ git clone https://github.com/gittower/git-crash-course.git

This will download the project to a folder named after the Git repository ("git-crash-course" in this case). If you want a different folder name, simply specify it as the last parameter:

	$ git clone https://github.com/gittower/git-crash-course.git other-name
